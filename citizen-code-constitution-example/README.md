# Introduction By Noah Thorp

I've been asked by many to share the governance process that we used at Citizen Code where the [CoMakery](https://www.comakery.com) platform was incubated. Citizen Code was a democratically run venture studio funded through consulting. We governed our company with a strict Holacracy in 2014 and then used the following "Citizen Code Constitution" throughout 2015 to collectively manage our company. Anyone who was a member of the organization could amend how the company was run by making pull request proposals. Our team size was between 5 and 25 people over the course of that time.

The constitutional approach worked pretty well for us and it's a bold experiment I'm proud of. Of course there were problems. For example, some of my biggest learnings were that often people dislike governance meetings; that democratic agreements with outside parties can be slow and that even if your values align; and that having a crystal clear common mission is crucial as more purpose driven action is encouraged.

Challenges aside, I think democratic organizations are an amazing way to work. I believe that future iterations on this model are a key part of how we will work together collaboratively to solve the big challenges of our time like: climate change, pandemics, corruption, economic downturns and just doing fair fulfilling work. 

And so I am excited to share our learnings with all of you who are continuing to evolve democratic organizations, coops, participatory orgs, DAOs and collectives working together in the spirit of creative collaboration. Let me know what you are up to by emailing me at noah@comakery.com where I am evolving a platform to help organize communities to make things together in the same spirit. There is much to collaborate on.

And without further ado...

# The Citizen Code Constitution

This constitution is how we agree to fulfill our collective purpose, make decisions, get things done, allocate resources, and respond to change. To clearly empower us we aspire to keep it simple.

# Mission

## Our Purpose Is To Create A Better Civilization by Building Tools That Enhance Collaboration.

We favor initiatives that envision and build:

* "Civilization 2.0" collaboration platforms for small business ecosystems, smart cities, marketplaces, governance, artists, and communities.
* "Tech to Connect" tools that increase empathy, connection, and constructive dialogue.

In support of our purpose, we invest in developing our personal capacity for effective collaboration and empathy. We aspire to build "Technology So Advanced It's Human."

# Values

We seek to employ these principles and values in our work at Citizen Code:

1. **Excellence** - Producing great products. Doing the best we can do for our clients.
1. **Empathy** - Care for each other. Create a culture of trust. Create structures that facilitate empathy.
1. **Efficiency** - Execute rapidly. Don't waste anyone's time.
1. **Alignment** - Choose clear collective goals that can be pursued in flexible ways.
1. **Empowerment** - Empower individuals to **permissionlessly** pursue their passions in support of the collective purpose. Give those doing the work decision making authority, budget, and resources to flexibly do the right thing. Make room for the plurality of personal passions.
1. **Transparency** -  Create accountability and support informed decisions by transparently sharing goals, progress, salaries, equity, expenses, and profit margins. Keep records of decisions we made and why we made them.
1. **Feedback** - Make incremental steps towards improvement with regular feedback. Favor immediate non-harmful solutions over delayed perfection. Encourage making mistakes in low risk conditions and sharing what we learned. Run experiments. Get advice from each other before making decisions.
1. **Regeneration** - Favor a sustainable pace that refreshes, energizes, and nurtures. Favor profitable and sustainable growth. Factor in externalities. Give back to the systems that support us.

# Governance

## Membership

Members of the organization can participate in the [Proposal Process](proposal-process), hold a [Role](roles), or employ the organization's resources; non-members cannot. Membership can be granted or revoked by a person who holds the “Role Assigner” role.

## Making Decisions

Members are free to take any action that fulfills the purpose of the organization and the roles that they hold as long as they do not break an explicit [Rule](rules.md) and they seek to uphold the values of the constitution.

Members are empowered to make decisions using their best judgement rather than relying on voting or consensus. Decisions about Budgets can only be made by Purchasers.

### Advice Process

When making decisions of significant impact the decider must seek advice and record decisions in this way:

1. Seek advice from people who are affected or have relevant knowledge. Consider what aligns with our purpose and values.
3. Make the decision and act on it.
4. Transparently and durably inform the community of the decision and rationale in the Citizen Code Constitution Wiki Decisions section or in email.

## Rule Making

[Rules](rules.md) govern the resources of the organization. They are decided through the proposal process.

## Role Definition

[Roles](roles) and their accountabilities are defined through proposals. Roles are defined separately from people.

People are assigned to roles by a person with a “role assigner” role. A person can be assigned to multiple roles. A person can resign from roles they do not wish to hold. People are only accountable for roles they hold.

## Processes

[Processes](processes) include roles, their interactions and decisions in achieving an outcome.

## Proposal Process

If you are personally experiencing a tension that cannot be addressed by [making a decision](#making-decisions), you may propose to create or modify a role, rule, purpose, or portion of the constitution. You can make your proposal in a GitHub pull request or at a meeting. The proposal must be made public to all Members such that they have the opportunity to clarify, give feedback, or object to the proposal.

### Governance Meeting Proposals

A [Facilitator](roles/citizen_services.md#facilitator) facilitates the process if it is an in person meeting. If no Facilitators are present, someone else can step up to facilitate but that person should not merge pull requests at the end.

For each un-merged proposal pull request, the facilitator takes these steps:

1. The person experiencing the need for change (the author of the pull request) reads their proposal to the group of affected people. They explain why the change is needed and what the proposal is, and why it is un-merged.
2. The facilitator asks if anyone has clarifying questions and lets people ask their questions and get answers.
3. The facilitator asks each group member for a reaction. A simple "no reaction" or a thumbs up is perfectly acceptable and speeds the process up.
4. The proposer may amend their proposal based on suggestions.
5. The facilitator asks each group member whether they object or not. The group member responds with “objection” or “no objection”. Only objections that are based on the belief that the proposal would cause significant harm are valid. Valid objections are resolved between the proposer and the objector. The proposer chooses how to amend their proposal based on suggestions. Modified proposals are then re-presented to the group for objections.
6. If there are no valid objections then the proposal is adopted.
7. The Facilitator merges the pull request.

### GitHub Pull Request Proposals

1. The proposer creates a new GitHub pull request for the proposal.
2. The tension that is to be addressed by the proposal is included in the commit message.
3. The change is announced to all Members on the slack #governance channel.
4. Members can respond with clarifications, reactions, and blocking objections. Any Member can abstain from participating.
5. Valid objections must include a reason that the proposal is believed to be harmful and not safe enough to try; it must also include either 1) a thumbs down emoji 2) the words "objection" or 3) a "-1".
6. Any facilitator can decree that the proposal is adopted if there is evidence that the final proposal has been seen by those who are significantly affected and there are no valid objections to the final version of the proposal for two days.
7. Anyone can request that the pull request be discussed in-person in the next governance meeting.
8. The proposer or facilitator can require that the pull request be discussed in-person in the next governance meeting.

Proposals that are adopted can be further modified through the proposal adoption process.

## Finances

### Budgets and Purchase Approval Process

**Employees are authorized to expense up to $250 per month** to further the collective Purpose. Proposals must be made for larger amounts.

Members propose Budgets or Purchases to Purchasers through Github pull requests. Purchasers indicate their individual approval by commenting on the pull request in Github with a :thumbsup: or +1.

Purchasers indicate the Budget proposal has been adopted by merging the pull request to the Budgets or Purchases page. The names of the Purchasers who approved the proposal must be included in the proposal.

Individual Purchasers may approve purchases or budgets of up to $2,000 in a any calendar month.

Any 2 Purchasers can approve a purchase or budget of up to $5,000.

Any 3 Purchasers may approve a purchase of up to $10,000.

As required by the Citizen Code LLC operating agreement, Co-founders must engage in a proposal process with other Co-founders before paying or borrowing more than $10,000; or increasing benefits to active Co-founders or company employees in an amount greater than $10,000 in any calendar year.

### Purchase Proposals

Purchase proposals must include:

* **What** is being purchased
* **Amount** of the purchase
* **Benefit** to the Purpose or Goals
* **Approving Purchasers** who approved the proposal

### Budget Proposals

Budget proposals must include:

* **Budget Title** that can be used in conversation to reference what the budget will be used for
* **Budget Owner** who decides how the budget will be spent to achieve a goal
* **Goal** that the budget will be used to achieve
* **Success Criteria** that determines if the goal has or has not been achieved
* **Amount** of currency or other resources
* **Time Limit** for achieving the goal
* **Approving Purchasers** who approved the proposal

Budgets targeted at Revenue goals are expected to demonstrate revenue and a path to profitability within a maximum of 6 months and $36,000 of investment by Citizen Code. Budgets that can demonstrate revenue and a path to profitability with lower risk are more likely to be approved.

Budget currency can be exchanged for **employee time at $100/hr**.

# Rules

### Project Estimation
To make story estimation more efficient, there will be 3 minutes to estimate each story and the team can vote thumbs up or thumbs down to continue the estimation, if there is a tie estimation continues.

### Hour Tracking

In order to track billable hours, the focus of our effort, and equity in incubated projects - all hours worked on client, partner, and internal products should be tracked in Harvest. This time includes project related emails, standups, retros, and meetings with the client. Company stand-ups and meetings are not included. These hours may be marked as non-billable or moved to an internal project based on a Citizen's judgement.

To satisfy company billing departments, each entry should be accompanied by a short comment on work completed.

When working on a day rate, or focused on a single project, a single entry for hours may be entered with a summary of work.

### Contract Approval

A contract coordinator must approve all contracts before they are signed.

### Tool Selection

Within budgetary constraints, you can use any tool you like for a role you perform. If multiple people need a common tool to perform work then the common tool must be proposed using the proposal adoption process. Uninterested people can opt out.

Tool decisions are recorded in the [Group Tools](#group-tools) section.

### Accounting Transparency

Because self-organization needs information; we will make accounting software (e.g. Harvest and Xero) read access available to employees and subcontractors of Citizen Code who have worked at Citizen Code for 30 days and completed at least 40 hours of work.

### Biweekly Payroll

Use these rules:

* Only use funds that are earned from retainer amounts
* If we have not received cash from clients for billable work it is not considered net cash. Exceptions to this with conversations.
* Vacation days for co-founders will be taken as accrued profit distributions and will be paid as funds are available.


Pay out in this order:

1. Pay Sub-contractors & Employees
2. Reimburse expenses
3. Pay bi-weekly co-founder profit accruals with cash available. Accrue remaining amounts.
4. Pay accrued co-founder payment rights First in First Out.

# Processes

## Internal Projects Process

### Overview

Process for generating ideas for incubation:

1. Exploration. Solidify an understanding of different customer problems

1. Focus. Facilitated group discussion about which problems/solutions
are most feasible, desired, & viable for validation. After discussion,
Citizens vote for the proposal they find matches the above
criteria using a
[two-round runoff vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system).
If a proposal does not receive the majority vote (>50%) in the
first round, voting is held again with the field narrowed to the top
two (or N, if there is a tie) proposals.

1. Validation. [Testing riskiest assumptions](https://vimeo.com/24749599) and validating
that a particular problem/solution is a good fit for CC to pursue

1. MTP Build. Building the minimum testable product (might be code, might not) once a
problem/solution is validated

With respect to #1, what will differentiate us as an innovation group is our capacity for
listening, empathy, & critical thinking. We can continue to deepen our capacity in this
area by having open, honest dialog about the different problems/opportunities we see and
by respectfully and thoughtfully challenging one another's assumptions.

### Structure

The process will have a "rounds" approach, where we go from an idea to validation
in each round. Our inaugural round will run through Steps #1-3 over the course of one month.

### Step Details

#### 1. Exploration

Ideas may be submitted at any point in time here.

General support for feedback on ideas:

* Slack
* Discourse

#### 2. Focus

A monthly facilitated meeting to review ideas and stack rank front-runners by
feasibility, desirability, and viability. These criteria are outlined more specifically
in our product scorecard

The internal project coordinator will make the final selection. 

Review the following blog posts for more context:

[http://blog.citizencode.io/post/112264193300/citizen-code-generating-great-ideas](http://blog.citizencode.io/post/112264193300/citizen-code-generating-great-ideas)

[http://blog.citizencode.io/post/112264463215/citizen-code-evaluating-great-ideas](http://blog.citizencode.io/post/112264463215/citizen-code-evaluating-great-ideas)

Edits to the scorecard criteria are welcome.

#### 3. Validation

Once we've identified a front-runner, any Citizen with bandwidth and interest(*) can work
together to gather qualitative feedback. This will be done primarily with customer
interviews but we will consider other ethnographic techniques as well. There is a Weekly
Techniques Meeting so we can discuss customer development tools and other validation
strategies/challenges.

If we find support for the chosen problem/solution in our interviews by the end of the
round, we will move on to Step #4 and start a lean build of an MTP. If not, we will
begin another round.


## Work For Equity Proposals

Tensions Addressed:
- Equity proposals should be considered by all affected

Process:

1. The person receiving the equity offer emails the following to citizens@
  1. Financial details: number of options/shares or percentages, dilutions, strike prices, exercise dates, office space, etc
  2. Resource details: are specific people needed
  3. Timing details: how long is the contract
  4. Context around the client relationship: how have things been so far working with them
  5. Context around product and market: describe product and how you think it will be a success
2. Allow for 72 hours of reaction time
3. Discuss cash availability with bookkeeper
4. Discuss staffing with staffing coordinator

## Work For Trade Proposals

Tensions Addressed:
- To maintain capacity for incubating internal projects trade proposals need to be monitored.

Process:

1. The person advocating the Work for Trade drafts a Statement of Work (SOW)
2. The SOW is proposed to the Contract Coordinator, Purchasers, Bookkeeper, and Project Manager using the proposal Processes
3. The Contract Coordinator is accountable for signing only an SOW with no valid objections
